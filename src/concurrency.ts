// Bounded-concurrency async mapper.
//
// Promise.all fans every item out at once, which is fine for cheap I/O but
// dangerous when each item spawns a child process (git diff, file reads): on a
// large commit this hit 100+ concurrent processes and risked FD/PID exhaustion
// on constrained CI. This caps the in-flight work at `limit` while preserving
// the input order of the results, so callers that depended on ordering (e.g.
// "newest-file-last" capture logs) keep behaving deterministically.
//
// A worker must handle its own errors: a throw/reject abandons the whole pool
// because the internal Promise.all rejects immediately and leaves the remaining
// in-flight work dangling (never awaited, never cleaned up). Wrap per-item work
// in try/catch and return a sentinel (e.g. null) on failure instead.
